# Snapshots

`take_snapshot.pl <name>` copies `session_tutorial` to `Snapshots/<name>` 

# Style conventions
_make some decisions and stick with them_

These are the style conventions used:
- `code` tags are for _what - methods and programs_ ?
- **bold** tags are for _what - filenames_ ?
- _italic_ tags are for _what - attributes maybe_ ?
