# How _YOU_ can help

The process of writing and editing means that there are many rough edges in the tutorial.
Fresh eyes see them more clearly.

The best way to suggest changes is to raise an
[Issue](https://github.com/duffee/Mojolicious_session_example/issues)
You can also email me at b dot duffee at keele dot ac dot uk.

## Instructions

Don't know much about Mojolicious?  **Great!**

Tell me where the Instructions are confusing or don't flow.

## Code

Know lots about Mojolicious?  **Great!**  'cuz I don't.

People in a rush will copy/paste code from anywhere.  Let me know
what is best practice and you might not have to clean up a big mess later.

### Quoting code

A quick way of quoting a bit of code is to copy the URL from the file in github
and stick the start and end line numbers (e.g. `#L1-L2`) on the end.
It takes the browser to the file and highlights lines 1 and 2.
e.g. the login method is currently at
`https://github.com/duffee/Mojolicious_session_example/blob/master/session_tutorial/lib/SessionTutorial/Controller/Tutorial.pm#L25-L30`

## Pull Requests

For some people, a pull request will be the most precise and concise method of
explaining a concept.  **Great!**  I will look at **all** PRs.
I may not accept your pull request on the basis it may require a lot of work
bringing the Snapshots and instructions into line.  In those cases, I'll
plan to include the changes suggested to keep the tutorial sensible
while the work goes on.  PRs that save me work will be readily accepted.

Oh, and please be patient with me.  I'll see your request within the week,
but might not find time to look at it for another five and I'm rubbish about
commenting in a timely manner.  If you change your mind, leave a comment or
else I'll still go through the closed PR.  Good intentions and all.

## Suggestions

What is the next step making in the natural progession of the learning curve?
Are there good locations to drop in exercises for the reader, 
using tests in conjunction with a skeleton along the lines of the
