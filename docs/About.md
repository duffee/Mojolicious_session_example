# About Mojolicious Session Example

Written by Boyd Duffee, 2015 - 2017

I wrote this tutorial in order to work out the technical
details required to implement a session-handling website.
This has been a case of learning-by-doing and then sharing.

The main page sits on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/duffee/Mojolicious_session_example/)

## Developement Environment

This example has been developed on 
Fedora 23 using Mojolicious 7.10, (Doughnut) and
Fedora 25 using Mojolicious 7.30, (Doughnut).

Running ```mojo version``` on my machine gives

 CORE
  Perl        (v5.24.2, linux)
  Mojolicious (7.30, Doughnut)


# Best Practices

Things I've been told:

## return false after failing authentication


# Acknowledgements

I've relied on the [Mojolicious Guides](http://mojolicious.org/perldoc) 
and the brilliant [Mojocasts](http://mojocasts.com/e1) with Glen Hinkle to get started.

This tutorial was inspired by Oliver G&uuml;nther's 
[Applications with Mojolicious](http://oliverguenther.de/2014/04/applications-with-mojolicious-part-one-introduction/)
series.  Is it wrong to wish a short span of unemployment on him so that we finally get to see
how to do I18N with Mojolicous Plugins?  He's given me good advice on testing strategies, so I'm conflicted.

I'd like to thank Stefan Adams for going through the instructions and providing
excellent questions and comments.  It's because of him that this tutorial makes any sense at all.
