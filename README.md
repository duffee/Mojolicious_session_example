# Mojolicious session example
A simple Mojolicious application example for authenticating a user and maintaining a session.

This example will show you how to 
* [set up](docs/Getting_Started.md) a Mojolicious application
* create a [login page](docs/Login.md)
* add simple [authentication](docs/Authenticate.md)
* re-direct to a landing page on successful login
* return to login page with message on failed login
* where to place pages that require authenticated access
* where to place pages that are publically accessible

if we get time we will show you how to
* add a plugin module, such as Mojolicious::Plugin::OAuth2 and configure it
* create a logout link and place it on your templates

Instructions on how to build this application are found in docs/
The first step is in [Getting_Started](docs/Getting_Started.md).
