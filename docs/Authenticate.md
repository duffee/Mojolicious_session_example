# Authenticating login credentials

To keep things clean, I've started a new app called Login
so that we can play with a new set of files that don't 
conflict with the other stages.  As a result you can run 
any of the stages by just stopping the morbo server and 
starting a different startup script.

```
mojo generate app Authenticate	# I've already done this bit
cd authenticate
```
This is just the same as in [GettingStarted](Getting_Started.md)
but with a new name under the lib and script directories which
is called in the start_app and new functions.

We'll look at these 3 files
* lib/Authenticate.pm
* lib/Authenticate/Controller/Login.pm
* templates/login/welcome.html.ep



# START HERE ****************************

## lib/Authenticate.pm
Add
```
$r->post('/login')->name('do_login')->to('Login#on_user_login');
```
* explain the named route, do_login and the controller, Login, where you need on_user_login

## lib/Authenticate/Controller/Login.pm
Ad in the on_user_login method to handle the credentials
```
sub on_user_login {
  my $self = shift;

  my $username = $self->param('username');
  my $password = $self->param('password');

  if (check_credentials($username, $password)) {
    return $self->render(user => $username, template => 'login/welcome');
  } 
  else {
    return $self->render(text => '<h2>Login failed</h2><a href="/login">Try again</a>', status => 403);
  }
}
```
* explain that username, password have been POSTed to the controller
* note that "return" isn't required, but good form for chaining methods
* the check_credentials sub separates the password check from the login action
* quickest way of making sure you've got the right behaviour is to render to text, as in the failed login
* a better render method directs the render to a template

## templates/login/login.html.ep
fixed the form_for line to use the named route 'do_login'

## templates/login/welcome.html.ep
Added a new template as a landing page for successful logins

#### Notes ####

OJO! - the on_user_login method needs you to return the rendered objects

works for render(text =>), but not render(msg) which needs a template, I think


add a landing page for successful login
	templates/login/welcome.html.ep

# END NOTES *****************************

# Try it out
Start the server with
```
morbo script/authenticate
```
and click through the Login link on [localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
to get to the [Login page](http://localhost:3000/login)

# Test the app

Make sure the Authentication works correctly

Add 
```
TODO ***** Make a test for successful login and login failure
```
to `t/basic.t` and run
```
script/login test t/basic.t
```

# Next Step

Clicking on the Login button takes you to a page that doesn't exist
yet where we will need to check the user's credentials
using the instructions in [Authenticate](Authenticate.md)
